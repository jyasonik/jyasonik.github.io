		<h1>Hi, I'm Jake Yasonik.</h1>

		<p>
		I'm interested in machine learning applied to materials discovery, with applications in 
		pharmaceutical drug discovery and sustainability. Currently, I'm working on a few personal
		projects in this space.
		</p>

		<p>
		Previously, I was a tech lead on the founding team at <a href="https://osmo.ai">Osmo</a>: 
		a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-startup-is-using-ai-to-unearth-new-smells/">
		Google Brain spinout</a>. Before that, I interned at <a href="https://www.deshawresearch.com/">D.E. Shaw Research</a></li>, <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/">Google Brain</a></li>, and <a href="https://pfizer.com">Pfizer</a>. I also did academic research in the <a href="https://coley.mit.edu/">Coley Lab</a> at <a href="https://mit.edu/">MIT</a>. At MIT, I studied <a href="https://catalog.mit.edu/interdisciplinary/undergraduate-programs/degrees/computer-science-molecular-biology/">Computer Science and Molecular Biology</a> before taking leave to join the founding team at Osmo.

		<p>
		I enjoy reading memoirs, playing piano, running long distance, watching musicals, and drawing. I'm
		interested in public policy and social science too.
